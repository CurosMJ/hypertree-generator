Compile the Java program using `javac`, and then pass filename 
of the XML/XHTML file as the first parameter to the program.

I have included two sample inputs, sample1.xml and sample2.htm, 
and the corresponding outputs are in files output1.txt and 
output2.txt

Steps to run code :

javac HypertreeGenerator.java
java HypertreeGenerator ./file.xml
