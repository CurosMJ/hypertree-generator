Part 1

Compile the Java program using `javac`, and then pass filename 
of the XML/XHTML file as the first argument to the program.

I have included two sample inputs, sample1.xml and sample2.htm, 
and the corresponding outputs are in files output1.txt and 
output2.txt

Steps to run code :

javac HypertreeGenerator.java
java HypertreeGenerator ./file.xml

Part 2

You can specify operations, for example prime, head, tail, simpleTree
as arguments after the filename. You may specify a number (defaults to 1)
after head, tail, and simpleTree operations.

Example : 

java HypertreeGenerator ./sample.xml prime
java HypertreeGenerator ./sample.xml head 2 
java HypertreeGenerator ./sample.xml tail 1
java HypertreeGenerator ./sample.xml simpleTree 3
